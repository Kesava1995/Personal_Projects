Group Personal project: 

1) a) Developed GUI for Image Steganography using Tkinter – Encoding and Decoding. [Partially Guided Interface]
Developed a Tkinter-based GUI application for Image Steganography enabling message encoding and decoding within images. 
Implemented partial user guidance, drag-and-drop support, Shortcuts, Menu Bar

b) Dockerized the GUI app for cross-platform compatibility. Published on Docker Hub.


2) Developed two different GUI variants of Video Steganography 
[Interface adapted from Image Steganography GUI App]
•	RGB [Encoding- converts coded RGB image into BGR image and video created by repeating image | Decoding- image extracted, converted to RGB and code extracted] 

and 

•	BGR [Encoding- image converted to BGR and then coded and video created by repeating image | Decoding- image extracted from video, and code extracted]
which can encode a single image into video and also decode the video to get the encoded message.


3) Gamified Learning Platform | Datathon Project
Tech Stack: Python, Flask, SQLite, Hugging Face transformers, Chart.js, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
Designed and built a full-stack, multi-user web application deployed on an IBM Z (LinuxONE) virtual machine.
Developed a Student Portal featuring secure user registration/login, gamified learning (timed quizzes, badges, score history), and a dashboard 
to take both standard and teacher-assigned quizzes.
Engineered a Teacher Portal with a separate login and dashboard to manage classes, enroll students, and view class-wide performance analytics 
visualized with Chart.js.
Implemented a complete content management system for teachers to create, add questions to, and assign custom quizzes directly to their classes.
Integrated a live AI (Helsinki-NLP) model via a custom Flask API endpoint, providing on-the-fly translation of all quiz content (standard and custom) 
into multiple languages like French.

          
Solitary Personal Projects: 
         
4) Developed a Calculator web app for which code was written using JavaScript, HTML, CSS. It can also calculate GCD and LCM of 
   (N numbers and N fractions [Simplifies the input fractions before calculating and output fractions before displaying]). Bootstrap Enabled.
i) Performed Static Website hosting on AWS S3 and Azure Storage Account Container 
ii) Also deployed using GitHub 
iii) Dockerized and Deployed:
•	Containerized the app using a custom Dockerfile with NGINX base image
docker pull phani1123/calc-app:latest
•	Deployed using Kubernetes with multi-node setup (master & 2 workers)
•	Wrote YAML manifests for deployment & services (deployment.yaml, service.yaml)

5) Developed Tkinter GUI for Tic-Tac-Toe

6) Rock Paper Scissors – PHP Web App 
   Built a login-protected Rock Paper Scissors game in PHP with form validation, session-less login, and game logic. Used MAMP for local testing. 
   Demonstrated understanding of POST/GET, hashing, and condition handling in server-side scripting.

7) Login-N-Register - A PHP web application with MySQL database integration, providing user registration and login functionality 
A group of php pages built using HTML, CSS and PHP. 
Landing page=>index.php
Registration page=>register.php
Login page=>login.php
Tested using MAMP

8) Sudoku Puzzle Generator – Java Application using swing, awt, event, Random
Has 3 modes using Random: Easy (35-45), Medium (25-30), Hard (20-25). It detects all the three duplicate anomalies [row, column, box]

9) Netbanking Web Application| PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, MAMP
•	Built a secure netbanking prototype with user login, account balance display, and debit functionality.
•	Managed user sessions and real-time balance updates with MySQL integration.
•	Ensured data security through server-side validation and authentication.
Atomicity	✅ Yes	begin_transaction (), commit (), rollback ()
Consistency	✅ Yes	Business rules enforced via logic & updates
Isolation	✅ Yes	SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE
Durability	✅ Yes	InnoDB guarantees commit persistence
